\chapter{Abstract}

Everyone should have the opportunity to interact with code just as the average programmer does, no matter the condition or background they may have.
The Simple Cubic Language for Programming Tasks (\sculpt) is a programming language and artistic ecosystem designed to challenge the status quo of programming languages and computational thinking.
\sculpt disrupts the standard typewriter as the default interface for coding and programming languages with an intuitive, 3D interface and its specification.
This is done by creating programming and artistic constructs that become tangible objects such that, when composed, generate computable programs and art pieces.
Along the language, we provide a set of tools aimed to make art a tool for coding and programming an art form.
Also included in the ecosystem exists the Simple Cubic Language for Programming Tasks Environment and Runtime (\sculpter) to run and test programs before assembling the final sculpture.
The constructed language is a fully capable, Turing complete language that serves as a creative outlet as well.
Using said tools, we perform an empirical validation of the experience with novices and expert programmers alike.
The results show programming proficiency in solving small computational programs across several populations, and some really neat art!
