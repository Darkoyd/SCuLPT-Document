\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
In the creation of \sculpt we posit two objectives.
First, we require to build a fully capable programming language addressing the concerns described previously about the state of programming, computation and programming languages.
\sculpt is designed to be a visual and physical oriented programming language, with a heavy focus on the ease of use, computational correctness and aesthetics.

Second, we aim to evaluate the language in two main aspects.
First, we intend to evaluate the ease of the language to foster computational thinking without the intrinsic difficulties of current programming languages imposed by the current interfaces.
Second, we evaluate the properties of \sculpt as a paradigm that breaks existing preconceptions about programming languages and moves beyond 
the typewriter interface by leveraging artistic creativity as an alternative.
