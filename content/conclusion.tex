\label{sec:conclusion}
Artlang is a visual and physical oriented programming language that aims to lower the entry threshold to programming by leveraging artistic creativity as an alternative to the traditional typewriter interface.
We have presented the design and implementation of Artlang, a language that allows users to create physical sculptures that compile to valid programs.
Artlang's design choices make it possible for anyone to create programs without the need for prior programming knowledge, making it accessible and modifiable to a wide range of users.

While the validations done so far are only preliminary, they show promising results in terms of usability and accessibility, while resulting in interesting pieces of art.
