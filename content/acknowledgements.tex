\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Having so many to thank in such a small space is jarring, nonetheless, I'll be susinct.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Dr. Nicolas Cardozo, for listening to a weird idea from an even wierder student.
His guidance has been incredible not only in this work but also what follows from it.

I would also like to thank the members of the Crypto and PIL groups at the FLAGLab. They gave me a space to ramble about printed plastic pieces and
wierd programming languages.

I'll probably never be as good as a designer as my sister, Sara, but I'll always be grateful for
her help in making the SCulPT visual language, posters and documentation look good and work as intended.

I also owe a lot to my mother, who has always supported me in my endeavors, even when they seem a bit out there, rushing to help with the intense manual labour that went into this endeavour.

At times I've been told that I should be more serious, but I've always been quite aloof.
I'd like to thank my friends and my parter for putting up with me and my weirdness, and for always being there to help me out when I needed it.
Always at the ready to make me crack a smile or two when times got rough and my hands numb from hand-sanding every printed piece of SCulPT.

Lastly, I want to thank you, the reader, wheather obligated or not to read, for taking the effort to push through several pages of me rambling about
a quirky idea that turned into so much more.
I hope you find it as interesting as I do, and that you can see the potential in it.
