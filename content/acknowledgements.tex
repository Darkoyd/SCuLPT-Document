\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Having so many to thank in such a small space is jarring, nonetheless, I'll be susinct.
First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Nicolas Cardozo, for listening to a weird idea from an even weirder student.
His guidance has been incredible, not only in this work, but also in what follows from it.

I also thank the members of the Crypto and PIL groups at the FLAGLab. They gave me a space to ramble about printed plastic pieces and
weird programming languages.

I will probably never be as good as a designer as my sister, Sara, but I will always be grateful for
her help in making the \sculpt visual language, posters and documentation look good and work as intended.

I also owe a lot to my mother, who has always supported me in my endeavours, even when they seem a bit out there, rushing to help with the intense manual labour that went into this endeavour.

At times I have been told that I should be more serious, but I have always been quite aloof.
I would like to thank my friends and my parter for putting up with me and my weirdness, and for always being there to help me out when I needed it.
Always at the ready to make me crack a smile or two when times got rough and my hands numb from hand-sanding every printed piece of \sculpt.

Lastly, I want to thank you, the reader, whether obligated or not to read, for taking the effort to push through several pages of me rambling about
a quirky idea that turned into so much more.
I hope you find it as interesting as I do, and that you can see the potential in it.
